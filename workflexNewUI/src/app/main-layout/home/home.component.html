          <h2>What We Do</h2>
          <p>We are a platform for gigs. Gigs are quick short-term jobs that help you earn money. Our gigs are
            quick and remunerative.
            Could vary from 1 day gig to 1 year gig.</p>

          <p>We offer peer-to-peer, employer-to-employee or business-to-business gigs. Look for a skill ->
            Engage with
            them -> Pay, get your work done.</p>
          <h2>What makes us unique</h2>
          <p>We are India’s only platform to offer gigs across different verticals. Gigs could be contractual or
            freelancing in nature.</p>

          <p>We eliminate the concept of a ‘Resume’. Instead we have a 30sec video of a gig worker showcasing his/her
            skill.</p>
          <p>Through a single log in, you can achieve four different objectives:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Operate as an individual <b>gig-worker</b></li>
            <li>Operate as a company <b>gig-seeker</b></li>
            <li>Operate as an individual <b>hirer</b></li>

                        opportunities as a part of the work), it has been a lot difficult to start afresh and reach the
                        interview stage. Geethu, from Workflexi has been immensely helpful in making this possible!!</p>
